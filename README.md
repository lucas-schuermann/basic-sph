Basic 2D implementation of stable smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) solver

For further information, see SPH tutorials on [my website](https://lucasschuermann.com/writing), including an introduction to [SPH math](https://lucasschuermann.com/writing/particle-based-fluid-simulation) and a [simple SPH solver](https://lucasschuermann.com/writing/implementing-sph-in-2d).
